Airbnb Project Description:

The Airbnb project is a web-based platform designed to replicate the core functionalities of the original Airbnb application. It allows users to browse, book, and list properties for short-term stays. The project includes user authentication, property search with filters (location, price, type), booking management, and a review system. Hosts can register properties by uploading images, descriptions, and availability dates. The frontend is built using React.js for a dynamic user interface, while the backend uses Node.js and Express.js for RESTful API development. Data is stored in MongoDB, and user authentication is managed through JWT tokens. This project showcases a real-world full-stack application, combining user experience, secure data handling, and responsive design.
